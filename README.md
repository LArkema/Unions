This repository was created for my BSides Las Vegas 2025 Talk 'UNION SELECT * FROM hackers; Why We Should Be Building InfoSec Worker Power Through the Labor Movement'

If you want to learn more or get involved, [join the Tech Workers Coalition](https://techworkerscoalition.org/subscribe/) and say hi in the `#cybersecurity` channel!

In addition to the slides, I'm incorporating the [turn the tables](https://github.com/shaunagm/turn-the-tables) repository and its excellent collection of resources for tech workers looking to build and use power on the job - many of which were used creating the presentation.

I've also included [sources](#presentation-sources-by-slide) for headlines and images used in the slides.
